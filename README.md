# Brief Synopsis of the paper:
- B cells were characterized from two donors by LIBRA seq
- The first donor (corresponding to samples 54041, 54042, and 54043) had previously been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and all high affinity cross-reactive mAbs originated from this donor.
- The second donor (corresponding to sample 54044) was a healthy individual.
- 20/50 characterized mAbs cross-react between SARS1 & SARS2
- 5/50 characterized mAbs bind at least 3 Human CoVs
- mAb 54043-5 is particularly interesting. It is non-neutralizing, but bound all spikes tested from the A, B, and C lineages of Betacoronaviruses as well as in the subgenuses Alphacoronavirus/Pedacovirus and Deltacoronavirus/Buldecovirus.
